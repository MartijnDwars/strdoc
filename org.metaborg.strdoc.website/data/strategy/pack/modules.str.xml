                        CHANGES (by Joost Visser)
                        
                        Strategy pack-modules(pack, dep-base) now takes two additonal
                        options:
                        -dep target
                        -nodep
                        
                        The first one specifies the maketarget and basename of the
                        dependency file that is created. If this option is not passed,
                        the argument dep-base is used instead. Finally, the -nodep option
                        can be used to disable this and prevent any dependency file to
                        be created. Note that -dep takes precendence over -nodep.
                        
                        An additional strategy pack-modules(pack) was added that behaves
                        like pack-modules, except no default for the dependency file
                        base name needs to be specified. Hence, only the command line
                        options are relevant.

                        Refactored using new (config-style) option handling.
