                        This module contains generic one-pass traversals over terms.
                        
                        These traversals have been defined using the primitive term traversal
                        operators of Stratego, all, some and one, and the control operators of
                        language. This results is a wide variety of resuable term traversals.
                        
                        Term traversals can be categorized into classes according to
                        how much of the term they traverse and to which parts
                        of the term they modify. Please read the annotated source code
                        to see the breakdown.
