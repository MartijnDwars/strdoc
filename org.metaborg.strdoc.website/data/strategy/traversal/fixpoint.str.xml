                        A collection of strategies that keeps traversing a term until
                        no more applications of some strategy to the nodes can be
                        found.

                          innermost-tagged(s) reduces the subject term by applying s to
                          innermost redices first. Terms in normal form are tagged (using
                          attributes) to prevent renormalization.
