                          The strategy unify unifies a list of pairs of terms and creates the
                          most general unifier for them. The strategy is parameterized
                          by a strategy \verb|isvar| that determines the shape of variables.
                          
                          The result is a list of pairs \verb|(x1,p1)|, where \verb|x1| is
                          a term for which \verb|isvar| succeeds and \verb|p1| is the term
                          it should be substituted with to unify the terms.
                          
                          E.g. <unify(isvar)> [(t1,t2),(t3,t4),...] => [(x1,p1),(x2,p2),...]

                          The following equality strategy has an additional filter
                          that can be used for checking equality modulo alpha renaming.
                          The filter applies to the entire pair and can change something
                          in one term based on the other term.
