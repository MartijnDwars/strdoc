                        The memo operator makes a strategy
                        into a memoizing strategy that looks up the term to be transformed
                        in a memo table and only computes the transformation if the
                        term is not found.

                          <memo(tbl, s)> t first looks up the term t in the memo table. If
                          present the association in the table is produced, else the result
                          of <s> t is computed and stored in the table.
